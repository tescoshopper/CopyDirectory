# CopyDirectory
This is a Visual Studio 2019 Solution containing a C# console application project and a class library project. The purpose of the application is as a test harness for the referenced class library. IOFunctions class includes a function to asynchronously and recursively copy a source folder and its contents to a destination folder. The test harness will demonstrate the TAP pattern. It will begin the task to copy the folder, outputting the results to the UI without the UI thread becoming blocked. This is demonstated by a simultaneous "dummy" output to the UI. The asynchronous task is awaited before the application completes. The simplest method of generating an executable for demonstration is to publish the application from Visual Studio.
